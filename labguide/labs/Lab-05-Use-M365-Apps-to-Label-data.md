1. Close the Microsoft Word tabs that are open on your browser to exit from Word.

### Task 2 : Impact of that label
In addition to content marking, the label protection setting was set for encryption. Per the permissions that were configured with this label, members of the finance group can co-author documents with this label applied and users in the Contoso tenant can view (or any document/email with the label applied).  In this task you will send this document to an email address to which you have access (ie., a personal email address) and that is NOT part of the WWLxZZZZ.OnMicrosoft.com domain and see what happens when you try to open the attachment.  

1. From the Microsoft Purview home page, select the **app launcher icon**, and **right click on the Outlook icon** and select **Open in new tab**.

1. From the list that shows up, select the document you created and to which you applied the label **Test-label**. Select **Next** and select **Attach as a copy**.  Press **Send**.
