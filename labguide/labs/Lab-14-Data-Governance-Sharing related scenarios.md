# Lab - 14 - Data Sharing


With Microsoft Purview Data Sharing, data providers can now share data in-place from Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 and Azure Storage accounts, both within and across organizations. Share data directly with users and partners without data duplication and centrally manage your sharing activities from within Microsoft Purview.

A data provider creates a share by selecting a data source that is registered in Microsoft Purview, choosing which files and folders to share, and who to share them with. Microsoft Purview then sends an invitation to each data consumer.
