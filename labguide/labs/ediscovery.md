# Lab-15: Explore the Core eDiscovery workflow

## Lab scenario
In this lab you will go through the steps required for setting up Core eDiscovery and then go through the Core eDiscovery workflow, by creating an eDiscovery hold, creating a search query, and then exporting the results of the search.  Note:  Licensing for Core eDiscovery requires the appropriate organization subscription and per-user licensing. If you aren’t sure which licenses support core eDiscovery, visit Get started with Core eDiscovery.

## Lab objectives

In this lab, you will complete the following tasks:

+ Task 1: Add specific users as members of the eDiscovery Manager role group
+ Task 2: Create a case to start using Core eDiscovery
+ Task 3: Create an eDiscovery hold
+ Task 4: Create a search query

## Estimated timing: 60 minutes

## Task 1: Add specific users as members of the eDiscovery Manager role group
To access Core eDiscovery or be added as a member of a Core eDiscovery case, a user must be assigned the appropriate permissions. In this task, you as the global admin, will add specific users as members of the eDiscovery Manager role group.
