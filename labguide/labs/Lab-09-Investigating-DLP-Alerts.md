# Configure DLP Alerts

The main goal of the investigation stage is for the assigned owner to correlate evidence, determine the cause and full impact of the alert and decide on a remediation plan. The assigned owner is responsible for deeper investigation and remediation of the alert. The primary alert investigation tools are the Microsoft 365 Defender portal and the DLP alert management dashboard. You might also use Activity explorer to investigate alerts. You can also share alerts with other users in your organization.
