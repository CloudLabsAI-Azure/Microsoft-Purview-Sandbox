# Lab  07 - Implementing Microsoft Purview extension for Chrome

## Lab Overview

Microsoft Endpoint DLP allows you to monitor onboarded Windows 10, and Windows 11 and onboarded macOS devices running any of the three latest released versions. Once a device is onboarded, DLP detects when sensitive items are used and shared. This gives you the visibility and control you need to ensure that they're used and protected properly, and to help prevent risky behavior that might compromise them.

## Lab scenario

In this lab you'll be implementing the the Microsoft Purview extension for Google Chrome in a controlled lab environment.
To enhance data discovery and classification capabilities.

## Lab objectives

In this lab, you will complete the following tasks:
+ Task 1 â€“ Prerequisties
+ Task 2 : Create a Data Loss Prevention policy
+ Task 3 : Updating Endpoint settings
+ Task 4 : Test the Extension

### Task 1: Prerequisites

### Task 1.1: Configure the proxy server manually using "netsh" command

>**Note**: If you're onboarding Windows 10 or Windows 11 devices, we need to make sure that the device can communicate with the cloud DLP service.

1. From Start menu type cmd right-click **Command prompt** and select **Run as administrator**.

1. Enter the following command and press Enter:
    ```
    netsh winhttp set proxy 10.0.0.6:8080
    ```

   >**Note**: This will affect all applications including Windows services which use WinHTTP with default proxy.

### Task 1.2: Join device to Microsoft Entra

1. Select the Start menu and type, then choose **Settings** from the search results.
   
1. From the left menu select **Account** > **Access work or school** and click on **Connect** button.
   
1. On Sign in page select join to **Microsoft Entra ID** and sign in with following crendential

   * Email/Username: <inject key="AzureAdUserEmail"></inject>
   
   * Password: <inject key="AzureAdUserPassword"></inject>
  
### Task 1.3: Onboard Windows 11 devices into Microsoft 365

1. Open Microsoft Edge and go to  **Microsoft Purview compliance**(https://compliance.microsoft.com/) portal.

1. Choose Settings > Device onboarding.

1. Paste the script by right-clicking in the **Administrator: Command Prompt** windows and press **Enter** to run it.

   **Note:** The window closes automatically after running the script.

   >**Note:** If you have completed the onboarding process and don't see devices in the Devices list after an hour, it might indicate an onboarding or connectivity problem.

1. In the purview portal, in the left-hand menu, select **Devices** and if the device isn't displayed, please wait for a while.

    >**Note:** If you have completed the onboarding process and don't see devices in the Devices list after an hour, it might indicate an onboarding or connectivity problem.

### Task 1.4: Install the extension for Chrome on your Windows devices

### Task 4 : Test the Extension

In this task, you'll assess the implementation of the Microsoft Purview extension for Chrome and observe how the policy restricts activities that violate the established guidelines.

>**Note**: The policy will take one hour to take effect. Please proceed with the next exercise and return to complete this task afterward.

1. Create one word document with mutliple demo credit numbers and name the file as protected and save it one drive.
 
1. Search and select google chrome from start menu  and copy the link of a word document containing sensitive information, and then try to paste it in Google Chrome. Observe the notification indicating a lack of permission to access the file.

1. open another tab in google chrome and browse for (https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload) and upload the document that containing sensitive information notice how policy is blocked from upload protected file from unallowed browsers Cloud Egress
